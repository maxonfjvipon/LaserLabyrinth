# LaserLabyrinth

Third person 2D Top view action game :D
It was made as a course project when I was in the 2nd year of university

Rules
----------------------------
There is a light source. There are mirrors. There are you. Rotate and move the mirrors for the light to come to the gold button (Like in the old Price of Percia video games). The gold button opens the door. The door leads to the next level.

Features
----------------------------
Music :D

PS
----------------------------
